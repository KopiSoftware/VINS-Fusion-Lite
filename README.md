# VINS-Fusion-Lite
VINS FUSION lite version.



## Our works

- We trained a DBOW vocabulary with LIP6Indoor dataset. This model achieves 95% of the performance of the original model, and much smaller.
- We adapted program with a higher **opencv** version. It can be run on **Ubuntu20.04** with **opencv 4.2.0** now. 
- Memory leak problem is fixed. 
- This program is related to our program: [VINS_Lite_GPU](https://github.com/KopiSoftware/VINS_Lite_GPU). It can be run on a embedded device with CUDA such as Nvidia Jetson Devices.



## Installation
Please follow original [VINS Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion). The installation process is identical. You may need vitrual memory to compile the program.
